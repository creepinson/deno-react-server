# Nextjs-ish Routing with Deno

## Requirements
Deno :DDDDD

## Run
Type `make` on command line

## How It Works
You have the folder `/src/pages` and Deno will walk through the folder and create the routes using Oak (remove Oak after).

## Missing pieces:
- [ ] API routes;
- [ ] Styling;
- [ ] Get initial props;
- [ ] Client side nav (some route component, or anything);
- [ ] Serve static files;
- [ ] Customizable error page;
- [ ] Other things that I don't rememberâ€¦ :(
