# Nextjs-ish Routing with Deno
Project to emulate Next.js in Deno.js.

By the moment we only have the router based on pages, but more things will be added in the near future.

## Requirements
Deno :DDDDD

## Run
Type `make` on command line

## How It Works
You have the folder `/src/pages` and Deno will walk through the folder and create the routes using Oak (remove Oak after).

## Missing pieces:
- [ ] API routes;
- [ ] Styling;
- [ ] Get initial props;
- [ ] Client side nav (some route component, or anything);
- [ ] Serve static files;
- [ ] Customizable error page;
- [ ] Other things that I don't rememberâ€¦ :(
